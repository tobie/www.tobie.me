Hi and welcome to my little corner of the web.

My name is **Tobie Langel**. I live in Geneva, Switzerland.

I am the principal and founder of [UnlockOpen](https://unlockopen.com),
a boutique consulting firm
that helps organizations think strategically about open source
and align their open source effort with desired business outcomes.

My clients include top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel, Mozilla, or Airtable.

I am a voting member of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)
[Cross Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/).
I sit on [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)'s [Advisory Committee](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac)
and on the Advisory Board of [OASIS Open Projects](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

Previously, I was on Facebook's Open Source and Web Standards Team,
Facebook's Advisory Committee Representative at the W3C,
a [W3C Fellow](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows) supported by Facebook,
and W3C's Testing Lead,
where I helped kickstart [Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt),
a W3C-coordinated cross-browser testsuite for the Web-platform stack.
I have edited various web standards,
notably [Web IDL](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/),
which specifies the language used to define web interfaces 
and its JavaScript bindings.

You can find out more about my past and present work on [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/tobielangel).

I [write](https://medium.com/@tobie),
[speak](https://speaking.unlockopen.com/), and
[tweet](https://twitter.com/tobie) about open source on a regular basis.

I also have a [mailing list](https://unlockopen.com/list) that you can subscribe to.

An avid [open source contributor](https://github.com/tobie),
I notably co-maintained the [Prototype JavaScript Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_JavaScript_Framework),
and released various open source projects,
including an automated build system for editing standards on GitHub (used by W3C, WICG, WHATWG, and ECMA),
and a JavaScript dependency resolver which powered Facebook's Pages iOS app.

A while back, I wrote [Helvetictoc](http://www.helvetictoc.com),
a small web app that tells the time using words.
Some people liked it so much it became a real clock in Durham, England.
