Hi and welcome to my little corner of the web.

My name is **Tobie Langel**. I live in Geneva, Switzerland.

I work as an independent [open-source and web standards consultant](http://www.codespeaks.com)
for companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Mozilla, or Google.
I'm currently editing [Web IDL](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/),
which is used to describe interfaces implemented by web browsers.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer in Facebook's Open-Source and Web Standards Team,
as Facebook's W3C Advisory Committee Representative,
and W3C's Testing Lead.
You can find out more about my past and present work on [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/tobielangel).
It's generally up to date.

I [write code](https://github.com/tobie),
[tweet](https://twitter.com/tobie),
and occasionally post citations from articles that move me on [tumblr](http://blog.tobie.me/).

A while back, I wrote [Helvetictoc](http://www.helvetictoc.com),
a small web app that tells the time using words.
Some people liked it so much it became a real clock in Durham, England.

    I noticed the host laptop was running Arial instead of Helvetica.<br>
